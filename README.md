## Overview

**Feature selection** is a critical step in machine learning, directly impacting model
performance, interpretability, and generalization capabilities.

**Causal Feature Selection (CFS)** tackles the challenge by selecting features based on their causal
relationships with the target variable. It has been shown that a set of features known as the
**Markov blanket**, provide optimal predictability to the target.
However, recent work shows that many CFS methods are outperformed by non-causal models,
and struggle to generalize across domains.

**Your Mission**: Design a model that performs causal feature selection and achieves
robust performance across different environments.
