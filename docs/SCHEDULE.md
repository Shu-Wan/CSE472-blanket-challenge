# Schedule & Tasks

## Warm-up (Oct 10–21, 2025)

Familiarize yourself with causal feature selection concepts and implement a baseline method.

### Reading

1. Computational Methods of Feature Selection
   1. Feature Selection, Chapter 1
   2. Causal Feature Selection, Chapter 4
2. Introduction to Causal Inference
   1. DAGs, Causal Discovery, PC algorithm, Chapter 11

### Additional Questions

1. What are the main categories of feature selection? [blog](https://sebastianraschka.com/faq/docs/feature_sele_categories.html)
2. What's the goal of feature selection?
3. Why do we need causal feature selection?

## Phase 1 (Oct 22 – Oct 30, 2025)

*Is Markov Blanket the optimal feature set?*

Get hands-on experience of causal discovery, causal feature selection.
See if Markov Blanket is truly the minimal and optimal feature set.

### Reading

### Tasks

- Complete [Lab1](/labs/01_causal_discovery)
- Complete Lab2 (To be released)

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Implement your first causal feature selection method
> - compare with no feature selection model (all features)
> - compare with a non-causal feature selection method (filter)
> - compare with Lasso (embedded)

### Questions

1. Does MB truly give the optimal predictive performance?
2. Is CFS method always better than non-causal FS methods?

## Phase 2 (Oct 31 – Nov 5, 2025) (To be released)

*The Emperor’s New Markov Blankets*

## Phase 3 (Nov 6 – Nov 12, 2025) (To be released)

*Beyond the Markov Blanket*

## Final Evaluation (Nov 13 – Nov 27, 2025) (To be released)
