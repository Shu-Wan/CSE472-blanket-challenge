# Schedule & Tasks

## Warm-up (Oct 10–21, 2025)

Familiarize yourself with causal feature selection and get hands-on experience.

### Reading

1. Computational Methods of Feature Selection
   1. Feature Selection, Chapter 1
   2. Causal Feature Selection, Chapter 4
2. Introduction to Causal Inference
   1. DAGs, Causal Discovery, PC algorithm, Chapter 11

### Additional Questions

1. What are the main categories of feature selection? [blog](https://sebastianraschka.com/faq/docs/feature_sele_categories.html)
2. What's the goal of feature selection?
3. Why do we need causal feature selection?

## Phase 1 (Oct 22 – Oct 30, 2025)

*Is Markov Blanket the optimal feature set?*

Hi Challenger!

- Get hands-on experience of causal discovery, causal feature selection.
- See if Markov Blanket is truly the minimal and optimal feature set.

- Complete [Lab1](/labs/01_causal_discovery)
- See [Lab1 README](/labs/01_causal_discovery/README.md) for details

## Phase 2 (Oct 31 – Nov 5, 2025)

*The Emperor’s New Markov Blankets*

The Markov Blanket is having an existential crisis.

- Is the MB truly the minimal and optimal feature set?
- Is CD-MB useful in practice?

- Complete [Lab2](/labs/02_markov_blanket_iid)
- See [Lab2 README](/labs/02_markov_blanket_iid/README.md) for details

## Phase 3 (Nov 6 – Nov 12, 2025) (To be released)

*Beyond the Markov Blanket*

So… what's beyond the MB?

- Test whether MB is still useful in OOD settings.
- Propose new approaches to do causal feature selection for OOD scenarios.

## Final Evaluation (Nov 13 – Nov 27, 2025) (To be released)

*Enter the Challenge*

Your final test has come. We've seen the rise and fall of MB in IID and OOD settings.

Build a model that performs feature selection across environments without sacrificing predictive performance.
