# Pre-Project Questionnaire

This questionnaire is designed to assess your background and experience in
feature selection, causality, programming, and machine learning.

Your responses will help tailor the project to better suit your needs.

0. Name:
1. Github handle:
2. What's your experience with feature selection?

   - [ ] Basic (e.g., correlation, univariate selection)
   - [ ] Intermediate (e.g., recursive feature elimination, Lasso)
   - [ ] Advanced (e.g., feature importance from ensemble models, SHAP values)

3. What's your experience with causality?
   - [ ] What is that?
   - [ ] Basic (e.g., A/B testing, simple observational studies)
   - [ ] Intermediate (e.g., propensity score matching, instrumental variables)
   - [ ] Advanced (e.g., structural equation modeling, advanced econometrics)

4. What's your main programming language?

   - [ ] Python
   - [ ] R
   - [ ] other: ________

5. What's your coding experience?

   - [ ] Beginner (0-1 years)
   - [ ] Intermediate (1-3 years)
   - [ ] Advanced (3+ years)

6. What's your experience with machine learning?

   - [ ] Statistical methods (e.g., linear regression, logistic regression)
   - [ ] Traditional ML (e.g., decision trees, SVMs, ensemble methods)
   - [ ] Classic Deep learning (e.g., neural networks, CNNs, RNNs)
   - [ ] Modern Deep learning (e.g., transformers, pretrained models)

7. What's your experience with LLMs (Large Language Models)?

   - [ ] Chatting
   - [ ] Use APIs and Agents
   - [ ] I build and fine-tune models
