# Tasks

## Warm-up (Oct 10–16, 2025)

Familiarize yourself with causal feature selection concepts and implement a baseline method.

### Reading

1. Computational Methods of Feature Selection
   1. Feature Selection, Chapter 1
   2. Causal Feature Selection, Chapter 4
2. Introduction to Causal Inference
   1. DAGs, Causal Discovery, PC algorithm, Chapter 11

### Hands-on

- Set up the environment
- Implement PC on a simple dataset
- Learn how to evaluate graph recovery

### Questions

1. What are the main categories of feature selection? [blog](https://sebastianraschka.com/faq/docs/feature_sele_categories.html)
2. What's the goal of feature selection?
3. Why do we need causal feature selection?

## Phase 1 (Oct 24–Nov 6, 2025)

*Markov Blanket is the optimal*

### Reading

- Markov Blanket is the minimal and optimal feature set

### Hands-on

- Implement your first causal feature selection method
- compare with no feature selection model (all features)
- compare with a non-causal feature selection method (filter)
- compare with Lasso (embedded)

### Questions

1. Does MB truly give the optimal predictive performance?
2. Is CFS method always better than non-causal FS methods?

## Phase 2 (Oct 24–Nov 6, 2025)

*Beyond the Markov Blanket*

## Final Evaluation (Nov 7–27, 2025)
